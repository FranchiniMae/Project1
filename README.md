###I. Description: 

Larry the Penguin is hungry! Use your arrow keys to help him eat as many fish as he can before time runs out. Beware the black holes! 

###II. Technologies Used:

* Javascript
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* CSS
* HTML

####III. Unsolved Problems:

* Help make the arrow key boundaries consistent. Sometimes Larry the Penguin gets stuck outside and the player is no longer able to move. 
* Stop the fish and black holes from popping up where the penguin stands.
* Stop the play button from adding more grids.
* Help make the restart actually restart the game instead of just refreshing the page. 
* CSS challenge -- help center the div elements and make the page responsive.
